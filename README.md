# PyTorchSL — Spark Track

Welcome to **PyTorchSL**, a beginner-friendly learning journey to understand PyTorch through intuition, visualization, and hands-on coding.

This repository contains the **Spark Track**, the first part of the series.  
Spark Track is designed to introduce absolute beginners to the fundamentals of optimization, gradients, tensors, autograd, and simple model training — all in a visual and interactive way using Google Colab.
